Write test task specification in this file.

Task 2: This task periodically prints task status of each task in the system.

Tasks 3,4,5 and 6: This task allocates and frees a fixed amount of memory. We assigned them with the following priorities:
Task 3 - 3
Task 4 - 2
Task 5 - 4
Task 6 - 4

The tasks will get blocked if there is no memory available when os_mem_alloc() is
called.
A blocked on memory task will be resumed once enough memory is available in the
system.

When a certain amount of memory is freed, then the tasks will start executing in the following order: Task4, Task3 
and between Tasks 5 and 6, the task that is waiting longer will be chosen.

Init - initializes system resources and createsthe various tasks with different priorities. 
It initializes a memory pool where most of the memory is allocated to itself and frees the memory after the tasks have been created.
