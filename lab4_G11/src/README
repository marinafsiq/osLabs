produce.c : contains the code for the producer
consumer.c : contains the code for the consumer

Compile both the files using the following instructions:
gcc produce.c -o produce -lrt
gcc consumer.c -o consumer.out -lrt

where,
produce and consumer.out are the executable files

Then in order to test the functionality of the producer and consumer files, execute the following command:

./produce <N> <B> 
where N is the number of integers to be generated and B is the size of the mailbox queue
